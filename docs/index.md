# FinBound Documentation

This documentation site will host detailed architecture notes, API references, and
setup guides. For now it captures the essentials of Milestone 1:

- **Repository map** – see `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` for the comprehensive layout.
- **Quick start** – follow `QUICK_START.md` to get up and running.
- **Roadmap** – `ROADMAP.md` tracks the high-level timeline.

Future work:

- Add an MkDocs or Sphinx configuration.
- Publish API docs generated from docstrings.
- Link experiment reports and MLflow dashboards.
