      "additionally , key input assumptions and their sensitivity to the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are currently being reviewed by management .",
      "it is likely that the value of the generation business related property , plant and equipment , the intangible asset related to the electric security plan with its regulated customers and long-term coal contracts , the 4.9% ( 4.9 % ) equity ownership interest in the ohio valley electric corporation , and deferred taxes could change as the valuation process is finalized .",
