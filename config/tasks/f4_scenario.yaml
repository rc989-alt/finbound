# F4: Scenario Consistency / Risk Narratives
# Goal: Evaluate policy engine + scenario validators on forward-looking questions
#
# Core datasets: TAT-QA (has scale/derivation fields useful for scenario reasoning)
# Planned extension: Synthetic scenarios from FinQA/TAT-QA/FinanceBench facts
#
# Tests: "If revenue grows 10%...", "What if interest rates increase..."

task: f4
task_family: F4
description: "Scenario Consistency - forward-looking and risk-driven question handling"

# Current: TAT-QA (has arithmetic derivations that test multi-step reasoning)
datasets:
  - name: tatqa
    split: dev
    limit: 50
    filter: arithmetic  # Focus on questions with derivations

# Future: Add synthetic scenarios and SEC risk factor sections
# Synthetic scenarios:
#   - Take FinQA/TAT-QA facts and create "what if" variations
#   - Test policy engine's forecast detection
#   - Test scenario validator's consistency checking
#
# planned_datasets:
#   - name: sec_filings
#     sections: ["risk_factors", "md_a"]  # Management Discussion & Analysis
#     limit: 20
#   - name: synthetic_scenarios
#     base_datasets: [finqa, tatqa, financebench]
#     scenario_types: [growth, decline, sensitivity]
#     limit: 30
