# F2: Long-Context Retrieval Consistency
# Goal: Test retrieval + grounding at scale, uncertainty admission when filings lack facts
#
# Core datasets: SEC Filings (via SECFilingsClient)
# Planned extension: FinanceBench long-context questions
#
# Note: Currently uses TAT-QA as SEC loader is not fully integrated for evaluation.
# TAT-QA has hybrid table-text evidence which tests retrieval consistency.

# Current: TAT-QA (hybrid table-text, tests retrieval across evidence types)
datasets:

# Future: SEC Filings when loader supports evaluation mode
